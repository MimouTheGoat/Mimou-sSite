  <p>You can't get access to Microsoft Office Suite; however, there's a better open-source solution: LibreOffice.</p>
  <p>Now, you can't access LibreOffice online. Since it's open-source, there's no central funding to maintain online servers (they don't make any money). However, there is a <a href="LibreOffice.html">workaround</a>.</p>
  <p>If you have a Google account, it's pretty easy. You can just use Google's free services: Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Drive, Meet, Calendar...</p>
  <p>You can also create a free Microsoft account which allows you to access the web version of Microsoft Office.</p>
  <p>If you don't have a Google Account or a Microsoft Account, then follow the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=libreoffice+download+instructions">instructions</a> there.</p>
